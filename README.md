Team Members:Anvith BekalIshaan ChitreDivesh GuptaPurpose of the project:The Super Aid app is created to provide quick help in the form of volunteers to anyone who’s in an emergency. The emergencies can range from a flat tire to a serious health issue. Whether you’re a common bystander or the one facing the emergency, our app ensures that nearby community help shortly arrive at the scene.  Tools Utilized:- Firebase- Unity- C#- Google Maps directions API- Json- GitHub- Android - TrelloProblems that we encountered:The biggest problem that our team encountered was learning the majority of the backend logic required for the application. Our team had minimal experience with any kind of database or server. After shortlisting some potential databases that we could learn about in the next 36 hours, we decided to use Google’s Firebase because of its countless features. We overcame our biggest challenge by simply reading as much of the documentation as possible. Public Frameworks we used:- Unity- Google Maps Distance Matrix- Google Maps Directions- Unity Location Services- Firebase Authentication- Firebase Realtime Database- Voxel Busters Alert Notifications- Pixabay- Termly
