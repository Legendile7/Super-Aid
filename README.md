## Purpose:
The Super Aid app is designed to offer rapid assistance through volunteers to individuals facing emergencies, ranging from minor inconveniences like a flat tire to critical health issues. Whether you're a bystander or directly involved, our app ensures swift community support arrives at the scene.

## Tools Utilized:
- Firebase for backend functionality
- Unity for app development
- C# for programming
- Google Maps Directions API for navigation
- JSON for data exchange
- GitHub for version control
- Android for mobile platform
- Trello for project management

## Challenges Faced:
Our team encountered a significant learning curve in understanding the backend logic required for the application. With minimal prior experience in database and server technologies, we explored various options and ultimately chose Google Firebase for its extensive features. Overcoming this challenge involved intensive documentation reading and hands-on experimentation within a tight 36-hour timeframe.

## Public Frameworks Used:
- Unity for application development
- Google Maps Distance Matrix and Directions for navigation
- Unity Location Services for geolocation
- Firebase Authentication for user authentication
- Firebase Realtime Database for data storage
- Voxel Busters Alert Notifications for emergency alerts
